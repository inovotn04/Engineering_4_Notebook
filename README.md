## Launchpad Part 1

### Assignment Description

Countdown from 10 seconds to 0 (liftoff). Print that countdown to the serial monitor.

### Evidence

### Code
[Countdown.py](https://github.com/inovotn04/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Countdown.py)

### Reflection

Using a for loop for this is the easiest way. To make it count down and not count up make sure you have all three parameters in your for loop and the third one is negative. Also if you want it starting at 10 you're gonna need it to be 11 so it actually prints 10, if that makes sense.

## Launchpad Part 2

### Assignment Description

Countdown from 10 seconds to 0 (liftoff). Print that countdown to the serial monitor. Blink a red light each second of the countdown, and turn on a green LED to signify liftoff.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## Media Test

Your readme will have various images and gifs on it. Upload a test image and test gif to make sure you've got the process figured out. Pick whatever image and gif you want!
